# Leveraging PowerShell ImportExcel: Time Series Forecasting & Impact Estimation

This is the demo for the talk with title above at New York PowerShell Meetup on 16th November 2023 (Online).

## Abstract
In this online talk presented at the New York PowerShell Meetup, we delve into the practical applications of the ImportExcel module in PowerShell through two illustrative examples. The first example explores time series forecasting, while the second focuses on impact estimation. The outcomes can be effectively visualized and shared with business stakeholders to facilitate informed decision-making. The ImportExcel module not only empowers business stakeholders to analyze and experiment with results easily but also provides a flexible setup for dynamic and efficient adjustments as needed.

## Usage Instructions
This script is designed for live demonstrations and showcases different examples. For a smooth experience, it is recommended to run each part of the script separately. Detailed instructions for execution can be found in the corresponding YouTube video associated with this talk.
